## Pull Request Review Process

1. All pull requests must be reviewed by **at least two developers** before being merged into the `main` branch.
2. Reviewers should ensure:
   - The code follows the project's coding standards.
   - The functionality introduced by the pull request is working as expected.
   - There are no conflicts with the `main` branch.
3. Any required changes or improvements should be communicated via the pull request comments.
4. Once the pull request has been approved by two reviewers, it can be merged by one of the maintainers.

## Conflict Resolution

If there are conflicts with the `main` branch, the author of the pull request must resolve them before the pull request can be merged.

## Tests and Documentation

- Ensure all tests are passing before submitting a pull request.
- If the pull request introduces new functionality, make sure to update or add any necessary documentation.
